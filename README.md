# Two Types of Export/Import 

1) Defult export -- eg -> export default Header; 
   you have to import Header like this ----> import Header from '/Header'

2) Names export --> eg -> export const Header
   you have to import it in other component --> import {Header} from '/Header'

# At the end you will have only one js file that's do all the things

# if we have 1 js file then the size will be 2 big when we have two many components for a big application, on performance it will effects

# we have to make smaller bundles of these files that process is called as Chunking (App Chunking, code splitting, dynamic bundling, lazy loading)

# Import Grocery as like lazy loading, when i go to that link, only then load it's called on demand loading

# lazy is function given by react, named export {}
